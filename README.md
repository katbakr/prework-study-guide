# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This application was made to help students who are going through a coding bootcamp learn basic elements of the subject covering in their course prework. I developed this webpage to help me document notes I took about HTML, CSS, Git commands, and JavaScript while I worked through my own prework. This webpage allows students the ability to create a digital home for notes taken that can be accessed and referenced from any location and deviceand the ability to use console.log to randomly be assigned a section to study when time allows. This project taught me the basics of website development, how to build the project from the framework, adding visual appeal, and adding interactivity to my projects.

## Usage

This website can be used to be a study tool for students who are working through prework for coding, or students who are wanting a tool to decide which topic to study during down time. This webpage could be developed to include more topics as students progress through boot camp, so that eventually a student would have a source for all notes taken throughout classes to reference. A helpful tool to use this website as a study guide is the random subject selector that can be found in the DevTools console menu. In the console menu you can find a tool that says "Let's study <subject>! and this can be used to quickly and randomly choose a subject to devote study time to. Every time the page is reloaded a new subject should be chosen.
